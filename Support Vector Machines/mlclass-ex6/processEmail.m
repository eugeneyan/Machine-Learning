% ========================== Preprocess Email ===========================

% Find the Headers ( \n\n and remove )
% Uncomment the following lines if you are working with raw emails with the
% full headers

% hdrstart = strfind(email_contents, ([char(10) char(10)]));
% email_contents = email_contents(hdrstart(1):end);

% Lower case

% Strip all HTML
% Looks for any expression that starts with < and ends with > and replace
% and does not have any < or > in the tag it with a space
email_contents = regexprep(email_contents, '<[^<>]+>', ' ');

% Handle Numbers
% Look for one or more characters between 0-9
email_contents = regexprep(email_contents, '[0-9]+', 'number');

% Handle URLS
% Look for strings starting with http:// or https://
email_contents = regexprep(email_contents, ...
                           '(http|https)://[^\s]*', 'httpaddr');

% Handle Email Addresses
% Look for strings with @ in the middle
email_contents = regexprep(email_contents, '[^\s]+@[^\s]+', 'emailaddr');

% Handle $ sign
email_contents = regexprep(email_contents, '[$]+', 'dollar');


% ========================== Tokenize Email ===========================

% Output the email to screen as well
fprintf('\n==== Processed Email ====\n\n');

% Process file
l = 0;

while ~isempty(email_contents)

    % Tokenize and also get rid of any punctuation
    [str, email_contents] = ...
       strtok(email_contents, ...
              [' @$/#.-:&*+=[]?!(){},''">_<;%' char(10) char(13)]);
   
    % Remove any non alphanumeric characters
    str = regexprep(str, '[^a-zA-Z0-9]', '');

    % Stem the word 
    % (the porterStemmer sometimes has issues, so we use a try catch block)
    try str = porterStemmer(strtrim(str)); 
    catch str = ''; continue;
    end;

    % Skip the word if it is too short
    if length(str) < 1
       continue;
    end

    % Look up the word in the dictionary and add to word_indices if
    % found
    % ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
    % Instructions: Fill in this function to add the index of str to
    %               word_indices if it is in the vocabulary. At this point
    %               of the code, you have a stemmed word from the email in
    %               the variable str. You should look up str in the
    %               vocabulary list (vocabList). If a match exists, you
    %               should add the index of the word to the word_indices
    %               vector. Concretely, if str = 'action', then you should
    %               look up the vocabulary list to find where in vocabList
    %               'action' appears. For example, if vocabList{18} =
    %               'action', then, you should add 18 to the word_indices 
    %               vector (e.g., word_indices = [word_indices ; 18]; ).
    % 
    % Note: vocabList{idx} returns a the word with index idx in the
    %       vocabulary list.
    % 
    % Note: You can use strcmp(str1, str2) to compare two strings (str1 and
    %       str2). It will return 1 only if the two strings are equivalent.
    %
    for i = 1 : length(vocabList),
        if strcmp(str, vocabList{i})
            word_indices = [word_indices; i];
        end
    end
        
# test case for processEmail
# word_indices = processEmail("Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed. In the past decade, machine learning has given us self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web search, and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome. Machine learning is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times a day without knowing it. Many researchers also think it is the best way to make progress towards human-level AI.")
